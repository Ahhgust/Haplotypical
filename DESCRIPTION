Description: This package is for basic string manipulation. It is mainly aimed at
	data from next generation / massively parallel sequencing assays. It can naively
	estimate haplotypes from bam files, compute summary statistics on the resulting reads
	as well as performing fast pairwise alignment. Alignment is optimized for DNA sequences
	that are very close (1 substituion/indel apart), but the KSW2 library of Heng Li
	(https://github.com/lh3/ksw2) serves to estimate distances when the distance is greater.

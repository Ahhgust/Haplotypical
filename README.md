# STRait Razor 4.0

### Documentation
This is a prototype of STRait Razor 4.0! Use at your own risk! <br>
Seriously, I'm still developing this, but the general idea is <br>
to apply alignment to STRs. While this make some people nervous <br>
the idea is to apply it in such a way that that read alignment is <br>
invariant to the STR motif found in that individual. The advantage <br>
of this is that now we can decorate the haplotype identified <br>
with genomic information. <br>

The current implementation is written in C++ and integrated with R <br>
using the Rcpp package. <br>
